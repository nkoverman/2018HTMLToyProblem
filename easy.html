      <p>It is difficult to beat the tension of a Jenja tower on the brink of collapse, but as soon as someone makes a mistake the fun devolves into cleanup. With Toc-Toc Woodman, a Korean successor to the Jenga, not only does the game keep on going, you also get to take blocks with a tiny plastic axe. What could be finer?</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/games/skull/">Skulls (aka Skulls & Roses)</a></h2>
      <p>Playing a round of skulls is like an intense game of poker distilled down to bluffing and one-upmanship. Each player begins the game with four cards - three harmless roses, and one "poison" skull. After players take turns secretly stacking cards in front of them, a player will step up and bet how many roses they can uncover without hitting a skull. If they succeed, they get a point. Two points and you win. The catch, you can stop them by betting that you can pull even more roses. You may know that there is no way you can actually pull 6 roses without hitting Tom's skull, but hey, better to poison yourelf than let Sam get that last point.</p>
